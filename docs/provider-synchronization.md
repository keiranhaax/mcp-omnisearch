## v0.0.25 through v0.0.28

Each upstream functional change in the release changelogs that affects
providers, validation, retries, result delivery, MCP contracts, or
their tests is classified below. Dependency, package-manager,
version-bump, editor, and CI-only commits are handled separately after
the matrix.

This matrix records the provider surface at the synchronization audit.
The fork-only You search and You Research capabilities present then
were later retired and are not part of the current provider surface.

Replacing those with upstream's registry/response plumbing would change the fork's tool and status behavior.                                                          |

| Provider type/metadata cleanup (`386efb56c10b8b89140bbf78ed214f867bb55f70`)         | intentionally rejected | Its TypeScript-only cleanup and upstream README changes do not provide runtime response validation. Broad metadata/type refactoring is outside this contract sync; the fork's expanded provider metadata remains unchanged.                                                                |

Kagi is removed. Unlike the prior TypeScript interfaces, these schemas validate payloads at runtime.                                                                            |

Dependency/package-manager/version-bump commits interleaved with these
releases (pnpm, Valibot, `@types/node`, tmcp adapters/transport, tmcp,
Vitest, Vite+, Changesets, package versioning, and their merge
commits) are intentionally rejected for Task 2. The Zed settings
commit is also intentionally rejected. They are not provider-contract
fixes, and the fork already has a separately pinned dependency
baseline.

## Runtime-validation coverage and preserved shapes

The three pinned validation diffs were checked provider by provider:

- `21e97fc1c5a13d94826cc9a09fc2375c5cc1305a`: Brave, Exa, and Tavily
  are runtime-validated locally. Kagi is removed. At the audit, You
  search was a fork-only provider absent from the pinned upstream
  diff, so adding a new schema was outside that narrow port; the
  capability was later retired.
- `67a01d54b72d02e6acecd1cd7d57b2fc48186700`: Exa Answer, Linkup, and
  GitHub code/repository/user responses are runtime-validated locally.
  Kagi FastGPT is removed. Fork-only Brave Answers, Exa Deep Research,
  Tavily Research, and (at the audit) You Research are absent from the
  pinned diff and were not broadened in that task. You Research was
  later retired.
- `4ea9d2211bb4493a584433dde8c79aebde6c8848`: Exa Contents, Exa
  Similar, and Tavily Extract use provider-specific runtime schemas.
  Firecrawl Actions, Crawl, Extract, Map, and Scrape use explicit
  operation-aware schemas through the typed Firecrawl request/polling
  helpers. Fork-only Firecrawl Search and Agent are validated at those
  same boundaries, while their provider-specific tests are not
  evidence for this pinned upstream validation diff. Kagi
  summarization is removed. Fork-only Brave LLM Context is absent from
  the pinned diff.

The port deliberately preserves valid current-provider shapes that are
looser than the first upstream schemas: Brave may omit `web` and
include non-result rows; Tavily may omit `results`; Exa request/result
metadata may be absent; and current Firecrawl polling responses may
omit `success`, use terminal `failed`/`cancelled` states, contain
nullable page content, and place page URLs/errors in metadata.
Firecrawl request envelopes and provider-specific nested collections
are still validated before use; polling additionally requires a
recognized status.

Malformed-response errors contain only provider identity, issue count,
and `retryable: false`; they do not include Valibot issue summaries,
raw inputs, response payload values, response bodies, or headers. The
non-retry marker prevents repeated requests for deterministic schema
failures.

## Current provider-contract corrections

| Exa `pdf`, `github`, `tweet`, `startCrawlDate`, `endCrawlDate`         | intentionally rejected | These deprecated categories/parameters remain absent. Retired response fields such as `resolvedSearchType` stay optional.                            |
| Exa current `searchType` response field                                | applicable             | Accept `searchType` while preserving optional `resolvedSearchType` metadata compatibility for callers.                                               |
| Brave issue #137: omitted `web`, non-result rows, omitted descriptions | applicable             | Omitted `web` was already compatible; retain that behavior and minimally filter malformed rows/default descriptions.                                 |
| Firecrawl search highlights and plain descriptions                     | already implemented    | Current highlights arrive through the existing `description`/`snippet` fields. Controlled fixtures cover Markdown highlights and plain descriptions. |
| Firecrawl document/PDF scrape                                          | already implemented    | Existing `/scrape` markdown and metadata handling accepts the current document response shape; retain a controlled PDF fixture.                      |
| Firecrawl `research` category                                          | already implemented    | Preserve it as an ordinary academic-website filter returning web results; do not relabel it as the Research Index.                                   |
| Firecrawl v2 crawl request/status/page shapes                          | applicable             | Send `maxDiscoveryDepth`; accept status responses without `success`, terminal failure states, nullable content, and metadata URLs/errors.            |
| Tavily date and country API fields                                     | applicable             | Expand partial dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` and normalize location aliases/hyphens to Tavily's documented country values.                                   |

## Explicit non-goals

The following surface is intentionally rejected for this
synchronization commit:

- Firecrawl Developer Index and the `/search` `developer`
  category/group
- Firecrawl dedicated Research Index (`/search/research/papers` and
  related endpoints)
- Exa Agent
- Exa Connect and paid data-source integrations
- Kagi search, FastGPT, enrichment, or summarizer reintroduction
- new tools, new provider categories, or paid/enterprise feature
  surface
- dependency, package-manager, Vite+, CI, package-version, and
  server-metadata updates

This task also preserves local Firecrawl summary replacement, provider
dispatch, tool names, all schemas outside the Exa category correction,
remote pagination, URL/provider validation, runtime hardening, and the
bounded result store.
